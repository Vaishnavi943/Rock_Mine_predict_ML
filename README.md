# Rock_Mine_predict_ML
# It a ML Project called Rock vs Mine Prediction
# Used  the Logistic Regression Model which is a Supervised learning algorith and it is basically works for well for binary classification (0,1) problem.
# we have to basicaaly pedict the whether the object is rock or mine that's why we used the logistic regression model.
# Sonar data --> Data pre-processing --> Train Test Split --> Logistic Regression Model 
# New data --> Trained Logistic Regression Model --> rock or mine prediction
